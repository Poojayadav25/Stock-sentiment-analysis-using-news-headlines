# Stock sentiment analysis using news headlines

Here I have used the Kaggle dataset.this dataset is a combination of world news and stock price available on Kaggle. There are 25 columns of top news headlines for each day in the data frame, Date, and Label(dependent feature). Data range from 2008 to 2016 and the data frame 2000 to 2008 was scrapped from yahoo finance. Labels are based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index.

Class 1 – The stock price increased.
Class 0 – The stock price stayed the same or decreased.
